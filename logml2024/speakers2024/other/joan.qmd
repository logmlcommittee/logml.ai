:::{#person-profile}
:::

I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science, Data Science and Mathematics (affiliated) at the Courant Institute and the Center for Data Science, New York University. I belong to the CILVR (Computational Intelligence, Learning, Vision and Robotics) group and I co-founded the MaD (Math and Data) group. During Spring 2020 I was also a Member of the Institute for Advanced Study, part of the Special Year on Optimization, Statistics and Theoretical Machine Learning.

My research interests touch several areas of Machine Learning, Signal Processing and High-Dimensional Statistics. I am particularly interested in mathematical foundations of Deep Learning, covering optimization, representation and statistical aspects and their interplay. I am also interested in developing applications to computational science, in areas such as Quantum chemistry, cosmology and climate modeling.

As of Fall 2020, I am also a Visiting Scholar at the Flatiron Institute (Simons Foundation), at the Center for Computational Mathematics, where I am co-organizing a working group on the Mathematics of Deep Learning.
