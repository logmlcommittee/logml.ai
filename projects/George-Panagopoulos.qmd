## George Panagopoulos
George Panagopoulos is a postdoctoral scientist at the University of Luxembourg, researching graph neural networks and causal inference for biomedical applications. Before that,  he was working on machine learning for operations research as an applied scientist in the Algorithms and Optimization lab of Amazon Transportation Services in Luxembourg. He received his PhD in machine learning from the Data Science and Mining Team of the Ã‰cole Polytechnique, specializing in graph learning for forecasting and combinatorial optimization. Previously, he was a research assistant and obtained his M.Sc. in computer science with a focus on digital signal processing for neural/physiological data from the University of Houston.



## Project
During a marketing campaign, promotional codes are distributed in an effort to increase user activity.  Given a specific promotional budget, the campaign should minimize the outreach to users who will not respond, or even worse respond negatively.  Hence we want to build a model to predict which users will respond positively, a methodology called uplift modelling. In uplift modeling, we test the codes to a representative subset of the users and then train a model to predict the response of the rest of the user base. In this project, we will tackle uplift modeling using graph learning on an ecommerce system. We can also examine related causal inference problems in other contexts e.g. in social or biomedical experiments.
