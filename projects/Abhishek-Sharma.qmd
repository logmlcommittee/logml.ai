## Abhishek Sharma
Abhishek is an incoming DL Research Scientist at Illumina AI lab Cambridge and before that, did his Ph.D. in the Shape Analysis Group at Ecole Polytechnique.
His Ph.D. thesis is about Deep Functional Maps for 3D shape analysis. He is very interested in alignment problems in general and their applications in molecular biology.



## Project
3D Shape matching is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics with significant applications on biological data. In this project, we will take a closer look at Deep Functional Map (DFM) [1,2] paradigm for 3D shape matching.  You will become familiar with unsupervised DFM
frameworks [2] and investigate a couple of directions less explored in the DFM literature. First, most DFM literature strongly relies on precomputed Laplacian Beltrami (LB) eigenbasis. There have been some recent attempts that learn an embedding [3,4] instead. However, it is not entirely clear in which circumstances learned embedding is more robust and useful than LB eigenbasis. Secondly, we will investigate cycle consistency constraints in DFM that provides a strong regularization by jointly optimizing the maps over a collection of shapes. By the end of the project, you should better understand these topics from both theoretical and practical perspectives.
