## Abhishek Sharma
Abhishek is an incoming DL Research Scientist at Illumina AI lab Cambridge and before that, did his Ph.D. in the Shape Analysis Group at Ecole Polytechnique.
His Ph.D. thesis is about Deep Functional Maps for 3D shape analysis. He is very interested in alignment problems in general and their applications in molecular biology.


## Project
Predicting the effect of a (missense) mutation accurately is one of the central problem in biology. Currently, two paradigms dominate benchmarks for missense variant pathogenicity prediction, namely PrimateAI-3D and alpha-missense. Interestingly, both follow totally different approach in their learned model. While PrimateAI-3D is trained from scratch, alpha-missense follows a pretraining-finetuning strategy. Both  approaches rely on MSA, Protein 3D structures as input and attention mechanism in their  model architecture. Goal of the project is to explore alpha-missense pretraining-finetuning strategy and find simpler alternatives to the pre-training part that requires training an alphafold2 (predicting 3d structures from multiple sequence alignment).
