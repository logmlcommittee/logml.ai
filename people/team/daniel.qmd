Daniel is a postdoc at King's College London working on differential geometry. He obtained my PhD from Imperial College London for his thesis on gauge theory in dimension 7 on problems that are motivated by string theory. Because of this, he is interested in big datasets of Calabi-Yau manifolds. Apart from this, Lie groups and Â group actions are important for the kind of geometry that he studies and he is also interested in applications of differential geometry to group invariant machine learning.
