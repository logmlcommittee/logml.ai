Arne is doing his PhD at Imperial College London (LSGNT) under the supervision of Anthea Monod. He is working on adapting ideas from geometry and topology to discrete settings. Concretely, he is interested in different tools of topological data analysis like persistent homology and Hodge Laplacians for simplicial complexes and other discrete structures.
