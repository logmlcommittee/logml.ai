Mike Heyns is a Schmidt Science Fellow at Imperial College London. The goal of my research is to use in-situ satellite data to deliver real-time space weather forecasting tools to the Met Office and ultimately at-risk end users, such as power utilities and railways. Mike has organised a range of summer schools, tutorials, and outreach activities both in the UK and South Africa.
