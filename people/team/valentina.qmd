Valentina is a second-year PhD student jointly affiliated with Imperial College London and Harvard University funded by the Medical Research Council, under the supervision of Prof. Marinka Zitnik and Prof. Adam Hampshire.
Her work lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, biology, and health, with a focus on neuroscience. She is interested in a holistic study of diseases across multiple levels — from cellular and genetic to brain structure and clinical phenotypes — to drive advancements in precision medicine. 
To achieve this, she works on research spanning bioinformatics, artificial intelligence, and clinical and behavioural analysis, with the aim to gain expertise that enables her to leverage diverse data types and insights for precision medicine. 
Specifically, she is focused on developing multimodal foundation models that integrate diverse data types to effectively capture the complexity of diseases while embedding context-aware knowledge.
Her long-term research goal is to investigate diseases using multimodal data (e.g., imaging, omics, and electronic health records) to capture diverse disease characteristics and identify precise, clinically applicable treatments.
