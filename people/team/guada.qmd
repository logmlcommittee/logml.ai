Guadalupe is a third-year PhD candidate at Imperial College London, supervised by Prof. Michael Bronstein and Dr. Kirill Veselkov. Her research lies on the intersection of graph machine learning and biomedical research, with a special emphasis on drug repositioning, combinatorial therapeutics and hyperfoods (i.e. molecules in foods with disease-beating properties) prediction.
