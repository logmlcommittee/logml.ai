Dr. Tolga Birdal is an assistant professor (Lecturer) and a UKRI Future Leaders Fellow in the Department of Computing of Imperial College London. 
Previously, he was a senior Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford University within the Geometric Computing Group of Prof. Leonidas Guibas. 
Tolga has defended his masters and Ph.D. theses at the Computer Vision Group under Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures, Technical University of Munich led by Prof. Nassir Navab. 
He was also a Doktorand at Siemens AG under the supervision of Dr. Slobodan Ilic working on “Geometric Methods for 3D Reconstruction from Large Point Clouds”. 
His thesis was awarded the prestigious EMVA Young Professional Award. 
His current foci of interest involve topological / geometric machine learning and 3D computer vision. 
His more theoretical work is aimed at investigating and interrogating limits in geometric computing and non-Euclidean inference as well as principles of deep learning. 
Tolga has several publications at well-respected venues such as NeurIPS, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICLR, T-PAMI, ICRA, IROS, ICASSP and 3DV. 
He is AC for CVPR, ICCV,  ECCV and is currently program-chairing 3DV 2025.
