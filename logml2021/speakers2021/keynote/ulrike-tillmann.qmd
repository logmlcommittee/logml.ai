:::

Ulrike Tillmann FRS is a mathematician working on topology and geometry. Much of her recent work in topology is motivated by questions from topological data analysis and data science.

She obtained her PhD at Stanford University, Habilitation at Universität Bonn, and now works as a professor of mathematics at the university of Oxford. She is on the editorial boards for a range of mathematical journals, including being the founding and managing editor for the Journal of Topology. She was awarded the Whitehead Prize by the London Mathematical Society (LMS) in 2004, a Bessel Forschungspreis in 2008, was elected an inaugural fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012, and has been a Fellow of the Royal Society since 2008.

Apart from that, she is active in outreach and for women in mathematics, for example acting as EMS–EWM Steering Committee Chair for summer schools at the Mittag-Leffler Institute 2015–20 and leading groups at Women in Topology and Women in Mathematical Physics.
