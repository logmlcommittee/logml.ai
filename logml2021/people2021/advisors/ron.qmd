Ron Kimmel is a Professor of Computer Science (and Electrical and Computer Engineering by courtesy) at the Technion where he holds the Montreal Chair in Sciences. He held a post-doctoral position at UC Berkeley and a visiting professorship at Stanford University. 
He has worked in various areas of shape reconstruction and analysis in computer vision, image processing, deep learning of big geometric data, and computer graphics. 
Kimmel’s interest in recent years has been understanding of machine learning, medical imaging and specifically computational oncology/pathology, precision medicine, optimization of solvers to problems with a geometric flavor, and applications of metric, spectral, Riemannian, and differential geometries. 
Kimmel is an IEEE Fellow and SIAM Fellow for his contributions to image processing, shape reconstruction and geometric analysis. 
He is the founder of the Geometric Image Processing Lab. and a founder and advisor of several successful image processing and analysis companies.
